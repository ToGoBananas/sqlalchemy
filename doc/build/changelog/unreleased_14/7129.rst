    Fixed bug in SQL Server ``DATETIMEOFFSET`` where the ODBC implementation
    would not generate the correct DDL, for cases where the type were converted
    using the ``dialect.type_descriptor()`` method, the usage of which is
    illustrated in some documented examples for :class:`.TypeDecorator`, though
    not necessary for most datatypes. Regression was introduced by
    :ticket:`6366`. As part of this change, the full list of SQL Server date
    types have been amended to return a "dialect impl" that generates the same
    DDL name as the supertype.
