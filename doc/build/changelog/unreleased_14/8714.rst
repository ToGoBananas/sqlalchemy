    Fixed issue with :meth:`.Inspector.has_table` when used against a temporary
    table for the SQL Server dialect would fail an invalid object name error on
    some Azure variants, due to an unnecessary information schema query that is
    not supported on those server versions. Pull request courtesy Mike Barry.
