    Added ``asyncio.shield()`` to the connection and session release process
    specifically within the ``__aexit__()`` context manager exit, when using
    :class:`.AsyncConnection` or :class:`.AsyncSession` as a context manager
    that releases the object when the context manager is complete. This appears
    to help with task cancellation when using alternate concurrency libraries
    such as ``anyio``, ``uvloop`` that otherwise don't provide an async context
    for the connection pool to release the connection properly during task
    cancellation.
