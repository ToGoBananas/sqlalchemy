    Fixed issue with :meth:`.Inspector.has_table` when used against a view for
    the SQL Server dialect would erroneously return ``False``, due to a
    regression in the 1.4 series which removed support for this on SQL Server.
    The issue is not present in the 2.0 series which uses a different
    reflection architecture. Test support is added to ensure ``has_table()``
    remains working per spec re: views.
