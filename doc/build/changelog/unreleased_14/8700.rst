    Fixed regression which occurred throughout the 1.4 series where the
    :meth:`.Inspector.has_table` method, which historically reported on views
    as well, stopped working for SQL Server.  The method never worked for
    Oracle in this way, so for compatibility within the 1.4 series,
    Oracle's dialect remains returning False for ``has_table()`` against a
    view within the 1.4 series.

    The issue is not present in the 2.0 series which uses a different
    reflection architecture, where has_table() reports True for views on all
    backends including SQL Server and Oracle. Test support is added within the
    1.4 series to ensure ``has_table()`` remains working per spec re: views.
