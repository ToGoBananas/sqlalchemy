    A :func:`_sql.select` construct that is passed a sole '*' argument for
    ``SELECT *``, either via string, :func:`_sql.text`, or
    :func:`_sql.literal_column`, will be interpreted as a Core-level SQL
    statement rather than as an ORM level statement. This is so that the ``*``,
    when expanded to match any number of columns, will result in all columns
    returned in the result. the ORM- level interpretation of
    :func:`_sql.select` needs to know the names and types of all ORM columns up
    front which can't be achieved when ``'*'`` is used.

    If ``'*`` is used amongst other expressions simultaneously with an ORM
    statement, an error is raised as this can't be interpreted correctly by the
    ORM.
