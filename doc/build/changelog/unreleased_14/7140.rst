    Fixed an inconsistency in the any_() / all_() functions / methods where the
    special behavior these functions have of "flipping" the expression such
    that the "ANY" / "ALL" expression is always on the right side would not
    function if the comparison were against the None value, that is,
    "column.any_() == None" should produce the same SQL expression as "null()
    == column.any_()". Added more docs to clarify this as well, plus mentions
    that any_() / all_() generally supersede the ARRAY version "any()" /
    "all()".
