    The :meth:`_engine.Inspector.reflect_table` method now supports reflecting
    tables that do not have user defined columns. This allows
    :meth:`_schema.MetaData.reflect` to properly complete reflection on
    databases that contain such tables.   Currently, only PostgreSQL is known
    to support such a construct among the common database backends.
