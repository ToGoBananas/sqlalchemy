    Fixed issue with :meth:`.Inspector.has_table` where it would return False
    if a local temp table with the same name from a different session happened
    to be returned first when querying tempdb.  This is a continuation of
    :ticket:`6910` which accounted for the temp table existing only in the
    alternate session and not the current one.
