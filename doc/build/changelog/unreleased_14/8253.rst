    Adjusted the SQL compilation for string containment functions
    ``.contains()``, ``.startswith()``, ``.endswith()`` to force the use of the
    string concatenation operator, rather than relying upon the overload of the
    addition operator, so that non-standard use of these operators with for
    example bytestrings still produces string concatenation operators.
