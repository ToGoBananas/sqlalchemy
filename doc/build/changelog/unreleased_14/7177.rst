    Fixed issue where "expanding IN" would fail to function correctly with
    datatypes that use the :meth:`_types.TypeEngine.bind_expression` method,
    where the method would need to be applied to each element of the
    IN expression rather than the overall IN expression itself.

.. change::
    :tags: postgresql, bug, regression
    :tickets: 7177

    Fixed issue where IN expressions against a series of array elements, as can
    be done with PostgreSQL, would fail to function correctly due to multiple
    issues within the "expanding IN" feature of SQLAlchemy Core that was
    standardized in version 1.4.  The psycopg2 dialect now makes use of the
    :meth:`_types.TypeEngine.bind_expression` method with :class:`_types.ARRAY`
    to portably apply the correct casts to elements.  The asyncpg dialect was
    not affected by this issue as it applies bind-level casts at the driver
    level rather than at the compiler level.
