    Fixed issue which prevented the :func:`_sql.literal_column` construct from
    working properly within the context of a :class:`.Select` construct as well
    as other potential places where "anonymized labels" might be generated, if
    the literal expression contained characters which could interfere with
    format strings, such as open parenthesis, due to an implementation detail
    of the "anonymous label" structure.
