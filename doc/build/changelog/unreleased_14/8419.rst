    Integrated support for asyncpg's ``terminate()`` method call for cases
    where the connection pool is recycling a possibly timed-out connection,
    where a connection is being garbage collected that wasn't gracefully
    closed, as well as when the connection has been invalidated. This allows
    asyncpg to abandon the connection without waiting for a response that may
    incur long timeouts.
