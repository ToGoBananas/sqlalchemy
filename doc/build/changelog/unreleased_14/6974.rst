    An extra layer of warning messages has been added to the functionality
    of :meth:`_orm.Query.join` and the ORM version of
    :meth:`_sql.Select.join`, where a few places where "automatic aliasing"
    continues to occur will now be called out as a pattern to avoid, mostly
    specific to the area of joined table inheritance where classes that share
    common base tables are being joined together without using explicit aliases.
    One case emits a legacy warning for a pattern that's not recommended,
    the other case is fully deprecated.

    The automatic aliasing within ORM join() which occurs for overlapping
    mapped tables does not work consistently with all APIs such as
    ``contains_eager()``, and rather than continue to try to make these use
    cases work everywhere, replacing with a more user-explicit pattern
    is clearer, less prone to bugs and simplifies SQLAlchemy's internals
    further.

    The warnings include links to the errors.rst page where each pattern is
    demonstrated along with the recommended pattern to fix.
