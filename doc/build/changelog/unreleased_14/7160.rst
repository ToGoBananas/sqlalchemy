    Fixed issue with :meth:`.Inspector.get_foreign_keys` where foreign
    keys were omitted if they were established against a unique
    index instead of a unique constraint.

    Added reflection support for SQL Server foreign key options, including
    "ON UPDATE" and "ON DELETE" values of "CASCADE" and "SET NULL".
