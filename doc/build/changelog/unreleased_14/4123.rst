    Repaired issue in new :paramref:`_sql.HasCTE.cte.nesting` parameter
    introduced with :ticket:`4123` where a recursive :class:`_sql.CTE` using
    :paramref:`_sql.HasCTE.cte.recursive` in typical conjunction with UNION
    would not compile correctly.  Additionally makes some adjustments so that
    the :class:`_sql.CTE` construct creates a correct cache key.
