    Fixed issue where bound parameter names, including those automatically
    derived from similarly-named database columns, which contained characters
    that normally require quoting with Oracle would not be escaped when using
    "expanding parameters" with the Oracle dialect, causing execution errors.
    The usual "quoting" for bound parameters used by the Oracle dialect is not
    used with the "expanding parameters" architecture, so escaping for a large
    range of characters is used instead, now using a list of characters/escapes
    that are specific to Oracle.
