    Fixed bug involving :class:`.Select` constructs which used a combination of
    :meth:`.Select.select_from` with an ORM entity followed by
    :meth:`.Select.join` against the entity sent in
    :meth:`.Select.select_from`, as well as using plain
    :meth:`.Select.join_from`, which when combined with a columns clause that
    didn't explicitly include that entity would then cause "automatic WHERE
    criteria" features such as the IN expression required for a single-table
    inheritance subclass, as well as the criteria set up by the
    :func:`_orm.with_loader_criteria` option, to not be rendered for that
    entity. The correct entity is now transferred to the :class:`.Join` object
    that's generated internally, so that the criteria against the left
    side entity is correctly added.
