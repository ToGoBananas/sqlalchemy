    Fixed issue where the ``nls_session_parameters`` view queried on first
    connect in order to get the default decimal point character may not be
    available depending on Oracle connection modes, and would therefore raise
    an error.  The approach to detecting decimal char has been simplified to
    test a decimal value directly, instead of reading system views, which
    works on any backend / driver.
