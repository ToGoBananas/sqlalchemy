    Fixed issue involving :func:`_orm.with_loader_criteria` where a closure
    variable used as bound parameter value within the lambda would not carry
    forward correctly into additional relationship loaders such as
    :func:`_orm.selectinload` and :func:`_orm.lazyload` after the statement
    were cached, using the stale originally-cached value instead.
