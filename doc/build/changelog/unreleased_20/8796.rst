    Additional performance enhancements within ORM-enabled SQL statements,
    specifically targeting callcounts within the construction of ORM
    statements, using combinations of :func:`_orm.aliased` with
    :func:`_sql.union` and similar "compound" constructs, in addition to direct
    performance improvements to the ``corresponding_column()`` internal method
    that is used heavily by the ORM by constructs like :func:`_orm.aliased` and
    similar.
