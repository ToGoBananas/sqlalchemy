    :tickets: 8878

    Added support for the :func:`.association_proxy` extension function to
    take part within Python ``dataclasses`` configuration, when using
    the native dataclasses feature described at
    :ref:`orm_declarative_native_dataclasses`.  Included are attribute-level
    arguments including :paramref:`.association_proxy.init` and
    :paramref:`.association_proxy.default_factory`.

    Documentation for association proxy has also been updated to use
    "Annotated Declarative Table" forms within examples, including type
    annotations used for :class:`.AssocationProxy` itself.


.. change::
    :tags: bug, typing

    Corrected typing support for the :paramref:`_orm.relationship.secondary`
    argument which may also accept a callable (lambda) that returns a
    :class:`.FromClause`.
