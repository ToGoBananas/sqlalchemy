    Stricter rules are in place for appending of :class:`.Column` objects to
    :class:`.Table` objects, both moving some previous deprecation warnings to
    exceptions, and preventing some previous scenarios that would cause
    duplicate columns to appear in tables, when
    :paramref:`.Table.extend_existing` were set to ``True``, for both
    programmatic :class:`.Table` construction as well as during reflection
    operations.

    See :ref:`change_8925` for a rundown of these changes.
