    Added new option to :func:`.association_proxy`
    :paramref:`.association_proxy.create_on_none_assignment`; when an
    association proxy which refers to a scalar relationship is assigned the
    value ``None``, and the referenced object is not present, a new object is
    created via the creator.  This was apparently an undefined behavior in the
    1.2 series that was silently removed.
