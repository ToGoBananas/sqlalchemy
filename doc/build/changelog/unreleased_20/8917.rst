    Fixed regression caused by the combination of :ticket:`8177`, re-enable
    setinputsizes for SQL server unless fast_executemany + DBAPI executemany is
    used for a statement, along with :ticket:`6047`, implement
    "insertmanyvalues", which bypasses DBAPI executemany in place of a custom
    DBAPI execute for INSERT statements. setinputsizes would incorrectly not be
    used for a multiple parameter-set INSERT statement that used
    "insertmanyvalues" if fast_executemany were turned on, as the check would
    incorrectly assume this is a DBAPI executemany call.  The "regression"
    would then be that the "insertmanyvalues" statement format is apparently
    slightly more sensitive to multiple rows that don't use the same types
    for each row, so in such a case setinputsizes is especially needed.

    The fix repairs the fast_executemany check so that it only disables
    setinputsizes if true DBAPI executemany is to be used.
