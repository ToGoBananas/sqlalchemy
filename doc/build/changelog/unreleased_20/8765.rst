    Complementing :ticket:`8690`, new comparison methods such as
    :meth:`_postgresql.Range.adjacent_to`,
    :meth:`_postgresql.Range.difference`, :meth:`_postgresql.Range.union`,
    etc., were added to the PG-specific range objects, bringing them in par
    with the standard operators implemented by the underlying
    :attr:`_postgresql.AbstractRange.comparator_factory`.

    In addition, the ``__bool__()`` method of the class has been corrected to
    be consistent with the common Python containers behavior as well as how
    other popular PostgreSQL drivers do: it now tells whether the range
    instance is *not* empty, rather than the other way around.
