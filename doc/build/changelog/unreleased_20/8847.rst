    Added a new type :class:`.SQLColumnExpression` which may be indicated in
    user code to represent any SQL column oriented expression, including both
    those based on :class:`.ColumnElement` as well as on ORM
    :class:`.QueryableAttribute`. This type is a real class, not an alias, so
    can also be used as the foundation for other objects.  An additional
    ORM-specific subclass :class:`.SQLORMExpression` is also included.
