    Modified the ``JoinedLoader`` implementation to use a simpler approach in
    one particular area where it previously used a cached structure that would
    be shared among threads. The rationale is to avoid a potential race
    condition which is suspected of being the cause of a particular crash
    that's been reported multiple times. The cached structure in question is
    still ultimately "cached" via the compiled SQL cache, so a performance
    degradation is not anticipated.
