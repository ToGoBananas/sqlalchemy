    Fixed bug in dataclass mapping feature where using plain dataclass fields
    in a mapping would not create a dataclass with the correct class-level
    state for those fields, copying the raw ``Field`` object to the class
    inappropriately after dataclasses itself had replaced the ``Field`` object
    with the class-level default value.
