    Added new parameter :paramref:`.AbstractConcreteBase.strict_attrs` to the
    :class:`.AbstractConcreteBase` declarative mixin class. The effect of this
    parameter is that the scope of attributes on subclasses is correctly
    limited to the subclass in which each attribute is declared, rather than
    the previous behavior where all attributes of the entire hierarchy are
    applied to the base "abstract" class. This produces a cleaner, more correct
    mapping where subclasses no longer have non-useful attributes on them which
    are only relevant to sibling classes. The default for this parameter is
    False, which leaves the previous behavior unchanged; this is to support
    existing code that makes explicit use of these attributes in queries.
    To migrate to the newer approach, apply explicit attributes to the abstract
    base class as needed.
