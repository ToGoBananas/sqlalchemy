    Fixed regression caused by improvements to PostgreSQL URL parsing in
    :ticket:`10004` where "host" query string arguments that had colons in
    them, to support various third party proxy servers and/or dialects, would
    not parse correctly as these were evaluted as ``host:port`` combinations.
    Parsing has been updated to consider a colon as indicating a ``host:port``
    value only if the hostname contains only alphanumeric characters with dots
    or dashes only (e.g. no slashes), followed by exactly one colon followed by
    an all-integer token of zero or more integers.  In all other cases, the
    full string is taken as a host.
