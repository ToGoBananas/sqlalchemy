    Fixed issue in support for the :class:`.Enum` datatype in the
    :paramref:`_orm.registry.type_annotation_map` first added as part of
    :ticket:`8859` where using a custom :class:`.Enum` with fixed configuration
    in the map would fail to transfer the :paramref:`.Enum.name` parameter,
    which among other issues would prevent PostgreSQL enums from working if the
    enum values were passed as individual values.  Logic has been updated so
    that "name" is transferred over, but also that the default :class:`.Enum`
    which is against the plain Python `enum.Enum` class or other "empty" enum
    won't set a hardcoded name of ``"enum"`` either.
