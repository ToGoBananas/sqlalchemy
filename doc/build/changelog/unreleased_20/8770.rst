    The RETURNING clause now renders columns using the routine as that of the
    :class:`.Select` to generate labels, which will include disambiguating
    labels, as well as that a SQL function surrounding a named column will be
    labeled using the column name itself. This is a more comprehensive change
    than a similar one made for the 1.4 series that adjusted the function label
    issue only.
