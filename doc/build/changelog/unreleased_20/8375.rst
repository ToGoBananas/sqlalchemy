    Added new parameter :paramref:`_orm.AttributeEvents.include_key`, which
    will include the dictionary or list key for operations such as
    ``__setitem__()`` (e.g. ``obj[key] = value``) and ``__delitem__()`` (e.g.
    ``del obj[key]``), using a new keyword parameter "key" or "keys", depending
    on event, e.g. :paramref:`_orm.AttributeEvents.append.key`,
    :paramref:`_orm.AttributeEvents.bulk_replace.keys`. This allows event
    handlers to take into account the key that was passed to the operation and
    is of particular importance for dictionary operations working with
    :class:`_orm.MappedCollection`.
