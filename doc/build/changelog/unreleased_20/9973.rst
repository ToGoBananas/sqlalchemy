    Additional hardening and documentation for the ORM :class:`_orm.Session`
    "state change" system, which detects concurrent use of
    :class:`_orm.Session` and :class:`_asyncio.AsyncSession` objects; an
    additional check is added within the process to acquire connections from
    the underlying engine, which is a critical section with regards to internal
    connection management.
