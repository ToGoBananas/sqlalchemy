    Added a new parameter :paramref:`_orm.mapped_column.use_existing_column` to
    accommodate the use case of a single-table inheritance mapping that uses
    the pattern of more than one subclass indicating the same column to take
    place on the superclass. This pattern was previously possible by using
    :func:`_orm.declared_attr` in conjunction with locating the existing column
    in the ``.__table__`` of the superclass, however is now updated to work
    with :func:`_orm.mapped_column` as well as with pep-484 typing, in a
    simple and succinct way.
