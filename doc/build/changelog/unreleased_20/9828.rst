    Improved :meth:`.DeferredReflection.prepare` to accept arbitrary ``**kw``
    arguments that are passed to :meth:`_schema.MetaData.reflect`, allowing use
    cases such as reflection of views as well as dialect-specific arguments to
    be passed. Additionally, modernized the
    :paramref:`.DeferredReflection.prepare.bind` argument so that either an
    :class:`.Engine` or :class:`.Connection` are accepted as the "bind"
    argument.
