    Fixed a suite of issues involving :class:`.Mapped` use with dictionary
    types, such as ``Mapped[dict[str, str] | None]``, would not be correctly
    interpreted in Declarative ORM mappings. Support to correctly
    "de-optionalize" this type including for lookup in type_annotation_map has
    been fixed.
