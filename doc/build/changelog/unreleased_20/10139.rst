    Fixed issue where the ``lazy="immediateload"`` loader strategy would place
    an internal loading token into the ORM mapped attribute under circumstances
    where the load should not occur, such as in a recursive self-referential
    load.   As part of this change, the ``lazy="immediateload"`` strategy now
    honors the :paramref:`_orm.relationship.join_depth` parameter for
    self-referential eager loads in the same way as that of other eager
    loaders, where leaving it unset or set at zero will lead to a
    self-referential immediateload not occurring, setting it to a value of one
    or greater will immediateload up until that given depth.
