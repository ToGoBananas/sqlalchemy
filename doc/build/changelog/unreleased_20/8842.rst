    :tickets: 8842

    Improved the typing for :class:`.sessionmaker` and
    :class:`.asyncsessionmaker`, so that the default type of their return value
    will be :class:`.Session` or :class:`.AsyncSession`, without the need to
    type this explicitly. Previously, Mypy would not automaticaly infer these
    return types from its generic base.

    As part of this change, arguments for :class:`.Session`,
    :class:`.AsyncSession`, :class:`.sessionmaker` and
    :class:`.asyncsessionmaker` beyond the initial "bind" argument have been
    made keyword-only, which includes parameters that have always been
    documented as keyword arguments, such as :paramref:`.Session.autoflush`,
    :paramref:`.Session.class_`, etc.
