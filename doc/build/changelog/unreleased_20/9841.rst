    A deprecation warning is emitted whenever a property is added to a
    :class:`_orm.Mapper` where an ORM mapped property were already configured,
    or an attribute is already present on the class. Previously, there was a
    non-deprecation warning for this case that did not emit consistently. The
    logic for this warning has been improved so that it detects end-user
    replacement of attribute while not having false positives for internal
    Declarative and other cases where replacement of descriptors with new ones
    is expected.
