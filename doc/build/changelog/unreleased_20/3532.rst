    A warning is emitted when an ORM :func:`_orm.relationship` and other
    :class:`.MapperProperty` objects are assigned to two different class
    attributes at once; only one of the attributes will be mapped.  A warning
    for this condition was already in place for :class:`_schema.Column` and
    :class:`_orm.mapped_column` objects.
