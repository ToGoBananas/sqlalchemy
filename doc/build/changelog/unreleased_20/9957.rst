    Fixed issue in ORM Annotated Declarative which prevented a
    :class:`_orm.declared_attr` from being used on a mixin which did not return
    a :class:`.Mapped` datatype, and instead returned a supplemental ORM
    datatype such as :class:`.AssociationProxy`.  The Declarative runtime would
    erroneously try to interpret this annotation as needing to be
    :class:`.Mapped` and raise an error.

    :tags: bug, orm, typing
    :tickets: 9957

    Fixed typing issue where using the :class:`.AssociationProxy` return type
    from a :class:`_orm.declared_attr` function was disallowed.
