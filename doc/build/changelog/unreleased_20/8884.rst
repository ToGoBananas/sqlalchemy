    Added additional type-detection for the new PostgreSQL
    :class:`_postgresql.Range` type, where previous cases that allowed the
    psycopg2-native range objects to be received directly by the DBAPI without
    SQLAlchemy intercepting them stopped working, as we now have our own value
    object. The :class:`_postgresql.Range` object has been enhanced such that
    SQLAlchemy Core detects it in otherwise ambiguous situations (such as
    comparison to dates) and applies appropriate bind handlers. Pull request
    courtesy Lele Gaifax.
