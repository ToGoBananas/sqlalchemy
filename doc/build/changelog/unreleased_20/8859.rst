    Added support custom user-defined types which extend the Python
    ``enum.Enum`` base class to be resolved automatically
    to SQLAlchemy :class:`.Enum` SQL types, when using the Annotated
    Declarative Table feature.  The feature is made possible through new
    lookup features added to the ORM type map feature, and includes support
    for changing the arguments of the :class:`.Enum` that's generated by
    default as well as setting up specific ``enum.Enum`` types within
    the map with specific arguments.
